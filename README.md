# 3D Ball Game Project

Project Detail: The 3D Ball Game Project is a Unity project I made in 2 weeks. This project was created as a way to help others just starting off learning Unity during my time as an Instructor. It touches on all the basics of C# programming and the fundamental concepts around the Rigidbody component which deals with game physics. This is a project I am proud of because I have used this project in lessons to help teach others 3D C# programming and Unity Game Development. The game loop is simple collect all the coins to activate teleporters to progress through the game.

Game Detail: During the 2 weeks I worked on this project I developed and implemented player mechanics and game features. The goal is to collect all the coins to activate teleporters! Teleporters allow you to progress to other areas/levels. So far there are only 2 sections to play through
