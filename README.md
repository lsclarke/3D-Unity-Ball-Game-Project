The 3D Ball Game Project is a Unity project I made in 1 weeks. This project was created as a way to help others just starting off learning Unity during my time as an Instructor. It touches on all the basics of C# programming and the fundamental concepts around the Rigid body component which deals with game physics. This is a project I am proud of because I have used this project in lessons to help teach other 3D C# programming and Unity Game Development. The game loop is simple collect all the coins to activate teleporters to progress through the game.
